# CePowerPaymentBook

**CePowerPaymentBook** is a demo application built entirely using [Compose Entity](https://github.com/SergeyBoboshko/ComposeEntity), showcasing a powerful approach to building Android apps with local databases by combining **auto-generated forms, ViewModel, and DAO** with **full customization**.

## рџ’Ў What is Compose Entity?

Compose Entity allows you to define your data classes and automatically get:

- SQLite tables
- Editing forms
- ViewModel with CRUD logic
- Save/Delete buttons

At the same time, you can:

- Replace default UI with your own Composables
- Write custom forms while still using auto-generated DAO
- Or go full auto-generation and plug in your data
